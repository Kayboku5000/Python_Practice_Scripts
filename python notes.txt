A little vocabulary: commands such as forward, left, and color are called functions. The numbers (or colors) that follow them in parentheses are called arguments. (This is just a funny name, it has nothing to do with arguing.)

For example, the line of code forward(200) can thus be described as such: the function forward is called with the argument 200.


Important note: The function penup and pendown have no arguments, so we put nothing in their parentheses. But they still require an empty pair of parentheses to be called!
penup   # this does nothing!
penup() # this lifts up the pen



This line is also indented, so we are still inside the piece of code that will be looped.

The two lines inside this loop must be indented by the same amount. But Python only requires consistency. You can see this by changing both lines to be indented by 2 spaces! The program will still work.
No more indentation! This marks the end of the for-loop.

The commands forward(100) and left(45) will be repeated 5 times over. The for-loop
for i in range(5):
    forward(100)
    left(45)


Short side note regarding vocabulary: In a function definition, the contents of the brackets are called parameters, not arguments. It is a small but subtle distinction:
def circle(radius): # here radius is a parameter
circle(20) # here 20 is an argument
