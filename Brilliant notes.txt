Eulerian geometry

If a ggraph has more than 2 vertices with an odd number of paths, there
is no eulerian path available. 
The vertices where odd number paths occur, must be the start and stop points. 
That's an example of the real power and magic of computer science: 
taking an intractable problem and making it tractable by understanding its structure.

When you solve a concrete problem, 
by understanding a more general problem (like Eulerian paths in graphs), y
ou can apply that general understanding to other problems.

if and else
describe a test;
list some instructions to run if the test succeeds;
list other instructions to run if the test fails.
